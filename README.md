# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical and lifestyle-related features. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to analyze health data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and compare multiple models to achieve reliable predictions.

This project was developed by me with the help of a few friends as part of a collaborative learning effort.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand and analyze diabetes-related data
* Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Train and compare multiple machine learning models
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
* Build a reproducible and beginner-friendly ML project

---

## 📊 Dataset

* Source: Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/code/tumpanjawat/diabetes-eda-random-forest-hp )
* Reference Notebook: Kaggle Diabetes EDA & Model Implementation
* Description: The dataset contains health-related features such as glucose level, BMI, age, blood pressure, and other medical attributes used to predict diabetes outcomes.
* Note: While the dataset and reference notebook were used as starting points, I implemented **additional algorithms, custom functions, and feature engineering** to enhance model performance and accuracy.


The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is used strictly for educational and learning purposes.
